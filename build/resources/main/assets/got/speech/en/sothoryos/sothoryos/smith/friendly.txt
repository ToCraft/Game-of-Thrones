Our obsidian blades will pierce the flesh of any creature!
Welcome, #. What would you like?
Are you looking for a cruel blade, #?
What can I get for you, jungle warrior?
I hope you have enough silver #.
My products are not expensive, but they are not cheap either, #.
The forge is hot today.
I'll pay you well for the obsidian shard.
Do you need strong armor, my friend?
Mighty rivers of fire flow deep in the earth. And in the mountains, this fire breaks out on the ground.
The earth cools the warmth of my forge.
There are huge accumulations of obsidian in the mountains.
I make powerful weapons out of obsidian, but I always need more ...
Do you like to fight something in a more secretive way? Go and talk to the shamans.
They say that in the days of the old empire, we fought with weapons in gold. Who would spend gold on such things?
Welcome, #. Perhaps you have obsidian to trade?
