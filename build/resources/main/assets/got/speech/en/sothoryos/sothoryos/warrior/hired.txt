We are fighting for you, #! Lead us to victory!
Death to the Harpy people!
Our empire will be reborn, #! We will lead you to victory!
The people of the Harpy have enslaved our people. We will destroy each of them!
The corsairs won't get mercy!
Go # and show our enemies what fear is!
Our enemies will flee in fear as you lead us into battle, #.
They won't last long against us, #!
They stole our sacred beasts, and now they will pay for it! To the war! To the war!
We will fight by your side, #.
The people of the Harpy and the people of the Thirteen will pay for their crimes!
They have no chance in battle with us, #.
Our empire will be reborn! Lead the forest people to victory, #!
We will follow you wherever you go, #.
