Help us destroy the pirates of the north, #!
The merchants of Quart must be destroyed.
There are other lands in the East. There are completely black fogs and black forests. No one returned from there alive.
They steal our people into slavery, so we will steal their lives, #.
Our great empire will rise again!
They're chopping down our trees, so let's chop their heads off, #.
The Harpy people are filthy bastards. We'll kill them all, #.
Our sarbakans are faster than any of their bows, #!
I am glad to see that you, #, a great warrior, are protecting us.
How many corsair geeks have you killed, #?
The jungle is our homeland, #, and we will protect them from those who want to take them.
The Harpy has no power over us! We will win!
What you need, #?
A warrior like you must fight for us!
How well do you know your wind pipe, #?
Help us fight wizards and corsairs, #. Help expand our empire again.
One day, our empire will once again become the most powerful in the whole world.
Death to the Harpy people!
Help us destroy the Harpy empire, #!
The merchants of Quart are friends with the pirates of Giscard. They are not worthy of mercy.
The pirates took our people into slavery and killed them in the arenas. Slash every pirate you meet.
Spiders from the East came here, devouring entire tribes. They must be destroyed.
The harpy is served by many pirates and sorcerers ... we must root this evil!
