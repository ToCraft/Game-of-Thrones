You are a brave warrior, #.
Are you a jungle fighter, #?
One day the jungle empire will be reborn.
The time has come. Our empire will be resurrected soon!
The northern corsairs will soon be crushed.
Neither the Harpy nor the Council of the Thirteen will ever take over these lands.
The trees in the jungle grow tall and strong, # like the people inhabiting them.
Our jungle warriors are stronger than any villain of the north.
These Harpy worshipers continue to steal our people!
Too often the Harpy people are raiding, chopping down our trees, and stealing our people!
Will you help our empire rise again, #?
I'm glad you share our hatred of pirates from the north, #!
The pyramids of the old empire are powerful and ancient, but many of them have long been lost to us.
Many of the treasures of our fallen empire are now lost in the jungle.
You look like a strong warrior, #.
This jungle is our home. Death to anyone who wants to destroy them!
Can you shoot with a wind pipe, #?
The Quart people are stupid merchants. We ate them.
What brings you to our jungle, #?
Welcome, wanderer from the North. I confess I am surprised that you have made this far south.
Most travelers from the North die of disease before they get here.
There are no Harpy fans among our people.
The people and ships sent by the Harpy have devastated our precious forests.
The old empire will rise again, someday.
The Ghiskari are primitive and cruel. There is no trust in them!
The Quartian merchants want to deceive us.
It is unwise to deal with pirates outside our forests.
Beware of the Harpy people, #. They kill both friends and enemies!
Our empire was once the greatest in the entire world.
There is a land at the edge of the world suffering from ice and snow. It's good that we don't have winter, #.
