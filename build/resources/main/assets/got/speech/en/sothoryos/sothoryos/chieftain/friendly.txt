Harpy people must pay for their crimes. Burn their houses, loot their treasures, kill their people!
Time for war, #. Wars against the pirates that stole our people.
Our empire is growing. Will you lead us to victory?
They burned our trees and stole our people. But now, #, it's time for revenge.
My people are valiant. Make the pirates of the north writhe in fear.
Drive them out of your homes with sword, poison and fire! Show these corsairs our wrath!
My warriors are at your disposal.
War will come to everyone. Lead my people to victory!
The power of the jungle will break the power of mortals!
Great diseases will make our enemies flee in confusion, #!
No mercy for the demons from the east!
