Leave these islands, #!
You don't belong in our homeland!
Die, savage from the continent!
You won't be here long, #!
A weakling like you won't last long on the islands!
I will feed you to crocodiles!
Run, servant of evil!
A barbarian from the continent! Get out, #!
Your death will be quick, #!
Run while you can, # however, it won't save you!
You're not welcome here, friend of the slavers!
You weren't killed by the beasts in the jungle? Then I'll do it!
You will choke on your own blood, #!
The slavers have no power here, #!
