I don't trust you, #. Come back later!
I don't need your mangoes, #.
Prove that you are a friend of my people, and then you can buy goods from me.
You look strange, #.
I doubt you have enough money for my items.
You are not like any of us.
I bet you like banana bread, #. Fool!
You are not an ally of my people, #. Away.
I doubt you are better than corsairs from across the sea, #.
Keep in mind, #, it's very unwise to make enemies in the jungle.
