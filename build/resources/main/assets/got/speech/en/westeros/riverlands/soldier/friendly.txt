Welcome to the Riverlands, #.
We are the doers of justice, we are Lord Tully's men.
These are tough times. The river lands were under attack.
I am a knight of the Riverlands.
Welcome, #. What business in the Riverlands?
Good day, #! Welcome to Tully Lands!
Hello #. What news have you brought from other lands?
We are ready to face the enemies, #. Family, duty, honor.
You are on time, #. A war for the Iron Throne is about to begin.
It seems to me that soon only ruins and mountains of ash will remain of Westeros.
We live in fear, #. If you do not like to take risks, I advise you to go to the lands of the prince, to Dorn. It's not safe here.
Have you seen Braavos, #? What a sight!
Stay away from the Wall, #. Strange people live behind her.
I heard stories about dragons when I was a child. But who knows if they really exist ...
