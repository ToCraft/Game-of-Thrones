Thief! The villain! Rogue!
You are the enemy of the Iron Islands.
Get out, #!
Go away, villain!
I will drive your head into the ground!
Leave, otherwise you will never leave here again!
You're not welcome here, #!
You are a freak!
I wonâ€™t make you anything, for the life of me
You made the mistake of coming here #!
Do you think this hammer can only knock on pieces of iron? I'll snitch on your boss now!
Well, I'll stuff your face!
I can not only forge swords, I can use them for their intended purpose! So get out, pick up, hello.
