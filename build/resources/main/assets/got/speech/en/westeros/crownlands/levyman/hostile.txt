You can't go any further. Royal lands are not your lands!
Warriors of the Royal Lands! Fight for your king!
I will not let you into the king's land, #!
For the king!
You are the enemy of King Joffrey, #!
Enemies have entered the lands of King Joffrey!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for the king's warrior!
No pity for the enemies of the king!
You won't live to see sunset, servant of the Starks!
Get out of our lands, wolf!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the king are not allowed to roam these lands!
