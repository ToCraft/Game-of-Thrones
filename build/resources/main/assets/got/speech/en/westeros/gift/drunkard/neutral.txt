You must prove that you can be trusted.
Are you friend or foe, #?
I believe that you should not be trusted. Try to convince me.
I respect you as a person, but I do not trust you strongly.
It's foolish to count on the fact that I'll just take it and believe you, #.
You need to become our strong ally, #.
You need to do more good deeds for our people.
Prove your loyalty and I will follow you.
