Hi, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome my friend. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What business are you with us?
Welcome, #. We are glad to new people.
Good day, #.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
How are you?
Where old people fall asleep, new life is born.
In our land, travelers do not often meet. What business are you with us?
Are you a rider, #? Or are you traveling on foot?
You're not from these lands, are you, #?
What village are you from, #?
It's a lovely day.
What's the news, #?
What kind of news did you bring us?
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I hope you have good news, #?
Tell me the legends of your land, #. This will make me very happy.
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Well, here we are.
I will not bore you with my boring reports.
