You can't go further. The lands of Dorn are not your lands!
Warriors of Dorn! Fight for your prince!
I will not let you into the Martell land, #!
For Dorn!
You are the enemy of Prince Doran, #!
Enemies have entered the Martell land!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for the warrior of Dorn!
No pity for the enemies of Dorn!
You will not live to see sunset, Servant of the Laniester!
Get out of our lands, lion!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of Dorn are not allowed to roam these lands!
