You can't go further. Get out of here while it's safe!
Warriors of the West! Fight for your king!
I will not let you into these lands, #!
For the West! For the Crown!
You are the enemy of the Crown, #!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a warrior of the West!
No pity for the enemies of the Crown!
You won't live to see sunset, servant of the Starks!
Get out of here, wolf!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the Crown are not allowed to roam these lands!
Hear my roar, wolf!
