I would not sell you a cup even if I was on the verge of ruin!
Get out, #!
Get out! People like you are not welcome in my tavern!
People like you are not welcome here!
You are not worthy of my mead!
You can eat wherever you want, # but not in my tavern!
You are not welcome here!
Get out of here, villain!
Get out, geek!
Here people like you do not serve!
Turn around and leave, # before I lose my temper.
Yes, I won't even share rotten meat with you!
You have tarnished the honor of my tavern, #.
I will not serve you.
Freaks like you are not served! Not here!
Get out of my tavern, assassin!
Lannister brat! No ale for you!
No entrance for thugs!
We don't serve killers, #! Go to another pub.
