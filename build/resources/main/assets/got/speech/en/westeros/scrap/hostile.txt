I will never deal with you again.
Let the rust take you, #!
Get out, freak!
I'm used to this. Learned to fend off thugs.
You are interfering with my business!
I do not plan to end my merchant days here!
A rusty blade under the ribs is a gift for you!
I will never buy your scrap metal!
I will not negotiate with the bandits!
In all my life I have never seen anyone dumber than you, #!
I may be a humble trader, but I'm not a weakling!
You will not see the next day, #!
You are fool, #!
Why did I even contact you ?!
You again, #!
Kill me and forever your equipment will be rusty like a millennial knife!
Your gold is fake, #!
Mango is nicer to me than your sword, #!
Get out, #!
I hope I won't see you again, #!
You will rot in the ground, #!
All the merchants in the world will spit on you!
It's a challenge, #?
Damn you, #!
Be you forever poor!
I curse your name and your goods, #!
Thief! Thief and murderer! Get out, #!
Don't you think to trade with me ?!
