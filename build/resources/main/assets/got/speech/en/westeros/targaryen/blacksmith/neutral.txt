You must make a name for yourself in the real king's lands to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted and that I will trade with you.
I am not sure if you are a follower of the king #.
Are you a supporter of our king, #?
I only trade with allies, #. I do not supply any equipment to Targaryen enemies.
I will not give armor to every stranger ...
You must prove your loyalty to the real King if you are to trade with me.
I don't trust you enough to surrender the armor just yet.
You must show your loyalty to our King before we can negotiate, #.
Only Targaryen followers can order equipment from me.
