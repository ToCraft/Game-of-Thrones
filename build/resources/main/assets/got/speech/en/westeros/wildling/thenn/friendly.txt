Filthy southerner! Oh, it's you, # ...
What do you want?
You don't look like tenn, #!
Hey you moron, come here! And it's you, #...
Coming soon, #! Soon we will go to war with the vile southerners!
And who are you after that?
The air is disgusting here.
We serve the King behind the Wall, #.
We will collect their bones and have a feast on the corpses!
Death to the southerners!
We will pass through the lands of the southerners like a plague, leaving nothing alive!
This rag stinks!
The Seven Kingdoms will be defeated and destroyed!
Something stinks here. So it's you, #! Go away!
If you bring me human flesh, I won't eat you! Hehe!
Mance prepares us for war. Soon the southerners will fall!
