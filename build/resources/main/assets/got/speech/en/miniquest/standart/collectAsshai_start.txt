Hi, #. Why did you come to our black land? However, not my business. Look, I have some alchemy and black magic experiments planned. Of the ingredients, I have everything except $. Bring me $ and I'll pay you generously.
ABOUT, #. Welcome to Asshai! What business are we doing? If suddenly you have no special business, then I can offer you a deal. You give me $, and I give you money. Going?
I don't know your name, but it seems to me that I saw you last year in the Quartisan market and bought $ from you. Or was it not you? In any case, I was pleased with the deal. Maybe we can repeat the deal?
