Stop and don't move! Your money or life!
What a lovely little thing you have, #! I'll take it for myself.
I wouldn't go into a fight if I were you!
I will get rich on your stuff!
Why do you need to carry so many unnecessary things? Let me lighten your burden!
Let's see what we have here ... aha! Goodbye!
It's time to pay!
Where are your coins?
Hey come here! I want to buy something from you ...
Your money is mine, slug! Give them back!
What's that shiny in your pocket? Is it a coin? Give it to me!
