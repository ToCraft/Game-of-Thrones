Do you want to hire shadow casters, #?
For a small handful of silver, you will be allowed to command the Asshai forces.
Our soldiers need pay, #!
Bring some silver coins, and only then will you receive our mercenaries.
Have you come for the mercenaries?
I can provide you with some guards in exchange for silver coins.
The Archmage's people now respect you enough to follow you into battle, #.
Shadow people trust you, #. You can acquire personal guards.
Even such witchcraft is permitted in Asshai, which the West is afraid to talk about.
For a few dozen silver coins you can get a shadow caster.
Give me some silver coins and I will give you some guardians!
