I won't sell you anything, #.
Sorry, #. I don't trade with bullies.
You are not welcome in this market, #!
If you even touch me or my goods with a finger, I will call the guards.
You are the stupidest person I know, #.
I don't trade with assassins.
Get out of here, slave brat!
Your presence is unnecessary, #. Get out of here.
I am an honest merchant, # but you are a dishonest person.
I confess that I consider myself an honest merchant. Unfortunately, #, honest traders do not trade with people like you.
Did you really think that we will greet you with flowers and songs, #? Go away!
Get out of our lands!
I don't want to tarnish my reputation, #. I only trade with honest people.
I only trade with good people, the subjects of Prince Pentos.
I don't trade with slave brat!
I won't buy anything from you!
What have you forgotten here? Get out of here, leave our lands!
I wouldn't trade with you even if the guards weren't watching us.
I'd rather die than give you my goods.
Go to Braavos and lick the slaves' asses!
