Hello, #! Have you come for my harvest?
I offer you the best vegetables of the Empire!
The seaside lands are very fertile.
All these lands near the sea are well suited for growing vegetables.
My employees work tirelessly.
My employees are very hardworking, #. You can hire them and they will make your garden look divine.
I work hard to fulfill the orders of our masters.
Our rulers ordered us to enlarge fields, make workers work harder, work harder. They need food to feed the army.
My summer residents work hard, #. We need to feed our army!
I offer my harvest with money. And my prices are fair.
To sell you something, #?
If you have hoes, buckets or anything else that can be useful for agriculture - talk. I will buy it from you. Will not be superfluous.
I have quite a few men and women looking for work, #.
There is good air and soil; the very thing for agriculture.
The soil of this country is perfect for growing crops.
Hello, #! Are you here to trade?
Good day to you, friend.
Good afternoon my friend. Are you for the grain?
