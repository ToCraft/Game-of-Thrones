Hi, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome my friend #. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What business are you with us?
Good day, #.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
The days are getting dark and the nights are getting cold.
I'm afraid we don't have enough food for the winter, #.
Oh, I have to go! Now the bell will ring!
What's the news, #?
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I am your faithful friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
I hope you have good news, #?
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
