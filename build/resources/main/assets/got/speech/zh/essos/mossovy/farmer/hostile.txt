You're not my friend, #.
You're a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
Run, #, otherwise I'll call the guards!
I will not allow you to commit outrages on my land!
Yes, you are a notorious villain, #.
Who let you in here?!
Be careful. Freaks like you are not safe here.
We don't respect criminals.
Please leave, #.
Away!
Our people hate villains! Get out while you're alive!
You'd better leave, #. Otherwise, you'll be carried out of here feet first.
You should be in the stocks, #!
Don't look at me like that.
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
We treat people like you badly.
Get out, #!
You should have left these lands a long time ago!
You will pay for your crimes, #!
We will not tolerate your presence in these parts, #!
You're a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
In a good way, please leave, #.
Get out of here!
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
You are not welcome here, #. Better get out of here in a good way
You're a brute! Back to where you came from!
Security! Security!
Murderers are not welcome in our parts.
You will pay for your crimes!
Stay away from me.
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
Away, villain!
There is no place for people like you here!
