Hello, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome, my friend #. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What are your business with us?
Welcome, #. We welcome new people.
Good afternoon, #.
Good afternoon, #! I just wish you a good day, and I'm not saying that it's a good day, whether you want it or not, and I don't mean that everyone should be kind on this day.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
How are you?
Have you heard the news about our friends, #? Will they send us help?
The days are getting dark and the nights are getting cold. Winter is coming.
Our horses are the fastest and strongest.
I'm afraid we don't have enough food for the winter, #.
Where old people fall asleep, a new life is born.
Aren't you a spy, #?
Travelers don't often meet on our land. What are your business with us?
Would you like to see my horses?
I'm afraid for our people.
Are you a horseman, #? Or are you traveling on foot?
Where are our riders, #? We need protection more than ever.
This kingdom is my home, #. And I will fight for it.
You're not from these parts, right, #?
I'd like to get into a noisy and cozy tavern right now, have a beer...
disturbing news has reached us. #, I have a lot to tell you about.
Do you have anything to drink?
From which village are you coming to us, #?
We are doing everything to survive. It's hard for us to live, #...
A beautiful day.
What news, #?
What kind of news have you brought us?
Tell me, #, what's going on in the world.
I am your loyal friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
Our crops have died, #. I hope we will have better luck next year.
It seems my crops are failing.
I hope you have good news, #?
Tell me a fairy tale, #. It will make me very happy.
I have to get back to work, #. These fields will not sow themselves.
Oh, #! We've met before, right? Or am I wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Well, here we are.
I won't bore you with my old stories about the village.
