This book is very special. What's this?

This book is generated from a text file. Scroll through the pages. This feature was a very popular request and I think it will give a fantastic sense of immersion in the world.

It was a hell of a job! It was very difficult to come up with code that would put a text file in a Minecraft book and page it beautifully. At the same time, the text does not creep out of the page. The book is like a natural one.

This means that you can find many books in the world now. They fall from mobs, they are in chests ... I, Hummel009, write these books and combine fragments from "The World of Ice and Fire" J. Martin so that you can get to know the world of Game of Thrones.

That's why this book is so special.
