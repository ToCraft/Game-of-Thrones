I fight for the West, #.
These deeds will restore the former glory of the West!
The enemies of the Crown will fall before us!
For the West! For the Crown!
Our enemies will fall before the might of the West, #!
You are a true friend, #.
Today we will fight! Let's fight for the Lannister house! For the king!
We will follow you even to Winterfell!
We are proud to be able to fight for a great man like you!
The enemies of the West will fall!
Hear my roar!
