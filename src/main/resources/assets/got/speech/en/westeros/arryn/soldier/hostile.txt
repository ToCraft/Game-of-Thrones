You can't go further. The Vale lands are not your lands!
Warriors of the Vale! Fight for your lord!
I won't let you into the Arryn lands, #!
For the Vale!
You are the enemy of Lord Arryn, #!
Enemies have entered the Arryn lands!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a warrior of the Vale!
No pity for the enemies of the Vale!
You will not live to see sunset, Servant of the Laniester!
Get out of our lands, lion!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the Valley are not allowed to roam these lands!
