Any enemy of the Vale is a friend of the highlanders!
We have vowed to take revenge on the people of the Vale. Will you fight us, #?
Our lands were taken by the knights. Well, nothing, I'll return them soon!
We mountaineers are proud, strong, but secretive people.
Death to the people of the Vale!
Death to the knights!
Our feud with the Knights of the Vale lasts for years.
Will you fight for us, #?
The lands of the Vale are rightfully ours! Andals are not worthy of them! We'll knock them out of there!
If the knights are your enemies, #, then we are glad to welcome you to our land.
What do you want?
The knights will pay for the atrocities they have committed!
Andal blood will soon be spilled!
Stranger, what do you want in the lands of the Highlanders?
Will you help us return what is ours by right?
The time will come when the Andals will answer for what they did!
