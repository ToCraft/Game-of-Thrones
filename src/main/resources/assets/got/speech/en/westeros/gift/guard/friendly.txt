We have been guarding these lands for a long time, #.
We, the Marines, have watched these lands for generations.
What brings you to this wasteland, #?
May your journey be fast and your raincoat warm, #.
Be on your guard, #. These lands are fraught with many dangers.
Good day, #. Where are you from?
Do not leave the camp at night and do not go beyond the Wall.
We do not guard these lands in vain, #. Many vile creatures have found refuge here.
This land is my home, #, and I will do everything in my power to protect it.
Watch out for the various creatures behind the Wall, #, there are many of them at night.
Wildlings are not yet visible, but wolves are already heard.
If we were not here, these lands would have been captured by the wildlings long ago.
My relatives have long guarded these lands from the dangers that lie to the north.
Be careful, #. These places are dangerous.
As long as we watch these lands, travelers like you will have a chance to return home alive, #.
