You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of the Storm!
You are the enemy of King Renly, #!
Get out of the lands of the Storm!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you #.
I'm not forging anything for the Lannister brat! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Ugly wolves! How dare you come to the lands of the Storm?
King Renly's brave men will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
