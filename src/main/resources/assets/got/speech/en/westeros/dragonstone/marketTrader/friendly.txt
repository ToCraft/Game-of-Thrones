Hi, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome my friend #. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What business are you with us?
Welcome, #. We are glad to new people.
Good day, #.
Good day, #! I just wish you a good day, and I do not claim that the day is good, whether you like it or not, and I do not mean that everyone should be kind on this day.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
How are you?
Have you heard about our friends, #? Will they send us help?
The days are getting dark and the nights are getting cold. Winter Is Coming.
Our horses are the fastest and strongest.
I'm afraid we don't have enough food for the winter, #.
Where old people fall asleep, new life is born.
Aren't you a Lannister spy, #?
In our land, travelers do not often meet. What business are you with us?
Do you want to see my horses?
I am afraid for our people.
Are you a rider, #? Or are you traveling on foot?
Where are our riders, #? We need protection more than ever.
This kingdom is my home, #. And I will fight for him.
You're not from these lands, are you, #?
I would like now to get into a noisy and cozy tavern, have a beer ...
Alarming news has reached us. #, I have a lot to tell you about.
Do you have anything to drink?
What village are you from, #?
We do our best to survive. It's hard for us, # ...
It's a lovely day.
What's the news, #?
What kind of news did you bring us?
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I am your faithful friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
Our crops died, #. Hopefully next year we will have better luck.
It seems my crops are failing.
I hope you have good news, #?
Tell me a story, #. This will make me very happy.
I have to get back to work, #. These fields will not sow themselves.
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Well, here we are.
I will not bore you with my old stories about the village.
