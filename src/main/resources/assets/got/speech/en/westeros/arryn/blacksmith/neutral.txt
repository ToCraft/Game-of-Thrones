You must make a name for yourself in the Valley to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted and I will trade with you.
I'm not sure if you are a supporter of Lord Arryn, #.
Are you a supporter of the Arrens, #?
I only trade with Arren supporters, #. I don’t supply equipment to Lannisters.
I'm not going to give out armor to every stranger ...
You must prove your loyalty to the Lord of Eagle's Nest if you wish to trade with me.
I don’t trust you enough to hand out the armor yet.
You must show your loyalty to the Arryn, #, before we bargain.
Only Arryn supporters can order equipment from me.
