You can't go any further. The Lands of the Expanse are not your lands!
Warriors of the Expanse! Fight for your lord!
I will not let you into Tyrell lands, #!
For Space!
You are the enemy of Lord Tyrell, #!
Enemies have entered the Tyrell lands!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a warrior of the Expanse!
No pity for the enemies of the Expanse!
You will not live to see sunset, Servant of the Laniester!
Get out of our lands, lion!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the Expanse are not allowed to roam these lands!
