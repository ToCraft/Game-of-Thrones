Welcome to the lands of the true king, #.
We are the makers of justice, we are the people.
These are hard times.
I am a knight of Drachenstein.
Welcome back, #. What's going on at Drachenstein?
Good day, #! Welcome to the lands of Targaryen!
Hello #. What news did you bring from other countries?
We are ready to face the enemy #.
You are on time, #. A war for the Iron Throne is just around the corner.
It seems to me that soon all Westeros will be ruins and mountains of ash.
We live in fear, #.
Have you seen Braavos, #? What a sight!
Stay away from the wall, #. Strange people live behind her.
I heard stories about dragons as a kid. But who knows if they really exist ...
