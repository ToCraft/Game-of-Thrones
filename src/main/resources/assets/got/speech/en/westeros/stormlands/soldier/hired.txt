I fight for Stormlands, #.
These deeds will restore the Stormlands to their former glory!
The enemies of House Baratheon will fall before us!
For the Storm!
Our enemies will fall before the might of the Storm, #!
You are a true friend, #.
Today we will fight! Let's fight for the Baratheon house!
We will follow you even to King's Landing!
We are proud to be able to fight for a great man like you!
The enemies of the Storm will fall!
We are angry!
