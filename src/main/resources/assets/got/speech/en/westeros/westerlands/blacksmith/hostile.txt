You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of the West!
You are the enemy of the Lannister, #!
Get out of the West!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you #.
I forge nothing for the wolves! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Ugly wolves! How dare you come to the lands of the West?
Lord Tywin's brave men will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
