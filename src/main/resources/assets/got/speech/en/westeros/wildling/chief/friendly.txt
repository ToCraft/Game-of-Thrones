My people are waiting for your command, #. Bring death to the Dunadans!
Crush our enemies, #!
My people will raise their axes to fight for you, #!
Everything for a strong warrior with a full wallet.
My mountaineers have no fear! Lead them into battle, #!
Soon we will bathe in the blood of our enemies, #!
We are loyal to the King behind the Wall. His enemies are our enemies!
My people for coins!
Lead our people to victory!
Go break and smash the skulls of your enemies!
My warriors will flood the battlefield with southern blood!
