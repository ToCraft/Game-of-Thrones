I don't sell my blades to everyone!
Money alone is not enough to buy my swords!
Who are you?
Come back when you are famous on all the Islands.
You are not worthy to wear my armor!
Prove that you are a hero and that you are worthy of my work.
The best blacksmith of the Isles trades only with the best warriors.
Glorify your name, #, and then I'll sell you my gear.
Only friends of the Ironborn are allowed to use the swords of my work, #.
