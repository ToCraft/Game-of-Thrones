Only the most loyal friends of the Riverlands can fight us side by side, #.
If you want to command our people, you must prove your trust.
Are you friend or foe, #?
Many people say that you are our friend and believe in the Lord of Light, but I will believe in this only when I can be convinced of it personally. As the saying goes: "It's better to see once than hear a hundred times."
You must become famous among our people to command my people.
We do not yet trust you enough to follow you.
Prove to us that you can be trusted, #, and we will fight together with you.
