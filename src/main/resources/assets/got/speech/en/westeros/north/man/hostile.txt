You are not my friend, #.
You are a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
Run, #, or I'll call the guards!
I will not allow you to commit atrocities on my land!
You're a notorious villain, #.
You are the enemy of the Starks, #, but they are not welcome here!
Who let you in here ?!
Be careful. Freaks like you are not safe here.
Leave the lands of the North, # while you still have the opportunity.
We do not respect criminals.
Please go away, #.
Away!
Our people hate villains! Get out while you're alive!
The heroes of the North will punish you, #. You will pay!
You'd better leave, #. Otherwise, you will be carried out of here with your feet.
You should be in stocks, #!
Do not look at me so.
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
We treat people like you badly.
You are a fool, #. It's incredibly stupid to meddle in here after all you've done!
Get out, #! Assassins are not revered in Stark lands!
Others take you, #!
