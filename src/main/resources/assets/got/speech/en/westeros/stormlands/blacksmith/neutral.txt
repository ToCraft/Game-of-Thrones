You must make a name for yourself in the Stormlands in order to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted and I will trade with you.
I'm not sure if you are a supporter of King Renly, #.
Are you a supporter of Renly Baratheon, #?
I only trade with Renly Baratheon supporters, #. I don't supply equipment to Lannisters.
I'm not going to give out armor to every stranger ...
You must prove your loyalty to the Lord of Storm's End if you wish to trade with me.
I donâ€™t trust you enough to hand out the armor yet.
You must show your loyalty to King Renly, #, before we bargain.
Only supporters of King Renly can order equipment from me.
