Welcome to the North, #!
Good day, #.
Welcome my friend #. What can I do for you?
The North welcomes you, #.
Dark times have come for Westeros, #.
There are rumors of terrible creatures living in the north ...
Welcome, #. We are glad to new people. But you'd better find Westeros on more favorable days.
These are dark times for us. All our enemies are united, they are gathering an army in the south.
This land is my home, #. And I will fight for her.
Westeros was once a vast and powerful kingdom. But those days are long gone ...
With all my heart I await the day when a worthy ruler will once again sit on the Iron Throne.
You're not from these lands, are you, #?
I would like now to get into a noisy and cozy tavern, have a beer ...
Alarming news has reached us. #, I have a lot to tell you about.
I have to warn you, #. Westeros is not what it used to be.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
How are you?
Have you heard about our friends, #? Will they send us help?
The days are getting dark and the nights are getting cold. Winter Is Coming.
How are you?
Do you have anything to drink?
You don't look like a Westeros, #. Are you an Esso for an hour?
What village are you from, #?
When I was still a child, I dreamed of becoming a Knight of the Royal Guard ... but those days are long gone.
We do our best to survive. It's hard for us, # ... but when the enemies come, real difficulties begin.
Good day, #! I just wish you a good day, and I do not claim that the day is good, whether you like it or not, and I do not mean that everyone should be kind on this day.
I hope that none of my family will be taken into Lord Stark's army.
This kingdom is my home, #. And I will fight for him.

Rumor has it that the Targaryens live overseas.
I heard that Joffrey is the son of Cersei Lannister and her brother. What an abomination!
Do you have anything to drink?
We do our best to survive. It's hard for us, # ...
It's a lovely day.
What's the news, #?
What kind of news did you bring us?
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I am your faithful friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
Our crops died, #. Hopefully next year we will have better luck.
It seems my crops are failing.
I hope you have good news, #?
Tell me a story, #. This will make me very happy.
I have to get back to work, #. These fields will not sow themselves.
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Well, here we are.
I will not bore you with my old stories about the village.
