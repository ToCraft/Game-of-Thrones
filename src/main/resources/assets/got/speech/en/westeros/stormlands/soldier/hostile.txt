You can't go any further. Stormlands are not your lands!
Warriors of the Storm! Fight for your king!
I will not let you into the lands of Renly Baratheon, #!
For the Storm!
You are the enemy of King Renly, #!
Enemies have entered the lands of Renly Baratheon!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for the Warrior of the Storm!
No pity for the enemies of the Storm!
You won't live to see sunset, Lannister servant!
Get out of our lands, brat!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the Storm are not allowed to roam these lands!
We are angry, but you are finished!
