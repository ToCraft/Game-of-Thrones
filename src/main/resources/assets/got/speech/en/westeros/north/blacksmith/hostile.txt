You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of the North!
You are the enemy of Lord Stark, #!
Get out of the Stark lands!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you, #.
I forge nothing for Lannister fools! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Lannister freaks! How dare you come to the lands of the North?
Lord Stark's brave men will quickly finish you off!
I will not give you anything, #!
