Welcome to the North, #.
We are the doers of justice, we are the Stark people.
These are dark times. The Lannisters are gathering an army in the south.
I am the Knight of the North.
What a shame ... It's a pity you did not see our lands in peacetime, #.
Welcome, #. What business in the North?
Good day, #! Welcome to the Stark lands!
Hello #. What news have you brought from other lands?
If the enemies gather all their strength into a fist and hit us, the next dawn, #, we will not see.
You are on time, #. Grigor Clegane's men raid our lands every week.
It seems to me that soon only ruins and mountains of ash will remain of Westeros.
We live in fear, #. If you do not like to take risks, I advise you to go to the lands of the prince, to Dorn. It's not safe here.
Have you seen Braavos, #? What a sight!
How long have I waited to see the Knights of the Valley in battle.
Stay away from the Wall, #. Strange people live behind her.
I heard stories about dragons when I was a child. But who knows if they really exist ...
