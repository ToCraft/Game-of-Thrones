You must make a name for yourself in the lands of Dorne in order to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted and I will trade with you.
I'm not sure if you are a supporter of Prince Doran, #.
Are you a supporter of the Martells, #?
I only trade with Martell supporters, #. I don’t supply equipment to Lannisters.
I'm not going to give out armor to every stranger ...
You must prove your loyalty to Prince Doran if you wish to trade with me.
I don’t trust you enough to hand out the armor yet.
