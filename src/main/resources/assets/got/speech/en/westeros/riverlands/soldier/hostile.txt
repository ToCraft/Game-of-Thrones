You can't go any further. Riverlands are not your lands!
Warriors of the Riverlands! Fight for your lord!
I won't let you into Tully lands, #!
For the River Lands!
You are the enemy of Lord Tully, #!
Enemies have entered the land of Tully!
I swear by the Seven, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a Riverlands warrior!
No pity for the enemies of the Riverlands!
You won't live to see sunset, Lannister servant!
Get out of our lands, Lannister brat!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the Riverlands are not allowed to roam these lands!
For honor, Lannister bastard!
