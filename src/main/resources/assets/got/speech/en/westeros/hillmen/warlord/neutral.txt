There are a few more things you need to complete, #, to make a name for yourself in our area. And only then will I allow you to hire my soldiers.
I almost mistook you for a knight.
You need to earn the trust of my people if you want them to follow you.
And what do you want?
You are still too young, #. Highlanders serve only real warriors!
Do you want to hire highlanders? First, prove that you are on our side, #!
We will not allow all strangers to command our mighty army!
The great warriors of the mountains will not go into battle after a weakling!
We will not follow a stranger.
Do you want to command my troops? Win the respect of the highlanders first!
Only the great heroes of our people are worthy to rule the troops!
