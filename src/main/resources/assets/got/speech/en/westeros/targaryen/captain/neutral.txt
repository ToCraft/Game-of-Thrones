Only the strongest supporters of the Tagaryer can command my army, #.
If you are to command a true king's army, you must prove we can trust you.
Are you a friend or an enemy, #?
Many people can say that you are on our side, but I cannot be sure of that until you have done enough good for us.
No man can receive and give orders to the soldiers of Dragonstone so easily. He has to earn this right.
They haven't done enough good for these people to obey them, #.
Show us that you are trustworthy # and we will let you lead our soldiers.
Do you want to command the Targaryen soldiers? First, prove your loyalty to our King, #.
Only a true believer in Targaryen can lead our brave soldiers into battle.
You must prove yourself a true Targaryer in order to command our forces.
Do more good deeds for the subjects of our people, then and only then will I admit command of my army.
Prove your loyalty and we will give you a squad.
