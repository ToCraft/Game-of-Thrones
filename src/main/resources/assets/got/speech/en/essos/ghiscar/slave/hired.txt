What do you order, sir?
I have to get back to work.
I'm afraid of lashes ...
I work like an ox, lord.
What should I do next, mister #?
I grew all this for you and did not eat a single piece ...
What is required of me, master?
I will do as you order.
May I get some bread, my lord?
I work as hard as I can! Please don't hit me!
What do you want from me, mister #?
