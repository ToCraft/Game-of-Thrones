My people serve the Emperor.
Don't be silly, #. Hire my scorers. They are the best warriors west of Bone Ridge.
My people have won many victories in the north. I do you the honor of being their commander. But not free.
I suppose I could give you a detachment as a friend of our people. But of course, you will have to pay for the equipment of this squad.
Our gentlemen are pleased with you. And they let me give you a detachment, albeit for a small fee.
Truly, #, you are a ruthless warrior. I would never have thought that one person could bring so much trouble to an entire state! I am grateful to you for your help in the fight against the Black Maiden ..
I have heard a lot about your exploits. I will let you command my warriors.
A fine warrior like you would be perfect to lead a raid on nomads.
The Merciful Emperor has ordered us to prepare for war.
Our Emperor is grateful to you for your help, #. He allowed me to give you a detachment, but you will have to pay their salaries.
You are ready? The Emperor is calling us north, #.
