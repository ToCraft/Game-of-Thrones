You must prove that you can be trusted.
Are you friend or foe of Pentos, #?
I believe that you should not be trusted. Try to convince me.
I respect you as a person, but I do not trust you strongly.
It's foolish to count on the fact that I'll just take it and believe you, #.
You need to become a strong ally of Pentos, #.
You need to do more good deeds for the Pentoshian people.
Prove your loyalty to Pentos and I will follow you.
