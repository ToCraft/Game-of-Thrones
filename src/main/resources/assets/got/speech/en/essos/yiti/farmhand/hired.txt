Good day, #.
The soil is good here.
Our crops are growing rapidly.
We must feed the armies of the Empire!
These crops will go to feed our armies.
I work hard, my lord.
In the West, meager farms and lazy workers are no match for ours.
Want to check the health of your farm?
Progress on the face, #.
There is a lot to grow here.
Our land is soft and fertile. It is a pleasure to work on it, to grow plants here.
All these lands near the sea are great for farming.
Do you have questions, #?
Welcome sir!
