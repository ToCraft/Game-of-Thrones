Hey #. What brings you here?
This is the original land of the Jogos Nhai people.
Have you been traveling for a long time, #?
Why did you come? Union, trade or war?
I haven't seen someone like you for a long time.
Have you come to seek friendship or death here?
Hope you're not a midget from the North, #.
How did you get here, #, and why?
You are not serving the Great Enemy to the South, #?
Do you want to join us and fight for Kitra?
Behold the greatness of Kitra Juvain! She came to fulfill a prophecy and destroy the empire of the South.
If you were a southerner, you would only have bones charred in the sun.
Have you heard the legend of Zhiy? She personally killed the Great Enemy and made a cup from his skull.
Strange, you crossed the mountains alone and survived.
Once upon a time, the Great Enemy ruled the lands from sea to sea.
I don't like stinking dwarfs from the North.
