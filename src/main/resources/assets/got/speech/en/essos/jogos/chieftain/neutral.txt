Kitra's warriors won't follow you, #.
Who are you? Are you a friend of Kitra or an ally of the emperor?
You won't get warriors.
Are you with us or against us?
Who do you serve, #?
You must kill and have mercy in the name of Kitra if you want to command the warriors.
Slay more Southerners to command the warriors of the Jogos Nhai people!
