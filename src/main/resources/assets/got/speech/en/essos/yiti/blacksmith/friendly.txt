Welcome to my forge, #!
I forge the finest armor in the entire Empire.
You will need this armor when you go to fight for the Emperor and the Homeland.
Fate demands that you buy armor from me!
Welcome, #. What can I offer you?
Do you like my job?
The armor of my work will knock off all daggers and stop arrows!
Gilded armor is very expensive, # but if you have enough money, I will forge it for you.
In the whole world there is no one equal to us in blacksmithing skills!
One of my blades could have saved your life.
My friend, I can create the best armor for you in the whole world!
Only a few have reached the highest level in blacksmithing. One of those workers is me.
I would be glad if you were safe all the time, my friend. And this is only possible in my armor.
Welcome, #! Do you need weapons or armor?
Ah, imperial steel. Nothing holds the edge like the steel of my people. Hard as dragon scales, light as a feather! Only Valyrian steel can rival it. But Valyria is gone ...
Hello #. Glad to see you in my smithy.
All the youth went to the North, #, and I was left without a student!
Any sword of mine will cut in half any nomad from the first blow!
It's hard to find good steel now. The best materials have already been wasted on military campaigns.
I have heard stories of your deeds, #, and it would be a great honor for me to equip you.
You can go around all the villages and towns on the other side of the mountains, but you will not find a better blacksmith than me.
Helmets, bibs, swords are all yours, my friend, as long as you have money.
Welcome to my forge, #. Our people are preparing for war, so I have to work day and night.
Thousands of people need a new sword or armor, #. But I think I can devote time to you.
