Hello, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome my friend #. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What business are you with us?
Welcome, #. We are glad to new people.
Good day, #.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
How are you?
Have you heard about our friends, #? Will they send us help?
You're not from these lands, are you, #?
I would like now to get into a noisy and cozy tavern, have a beer ...
Alarming news has reached us. #, I have a lot to tell you about.
Do you have anything to drink?
What village are you from, #?
We do our best to survive. It's hard for us, # ...
It's a lovely day.
What's the news, #?
What kind of news did you bring us?
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I am your faithful friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
I hope you have good news, #?
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Well, here we are.
Although we have a prince, the rich masters are in charge.
Many will deny this, but we came here before the Valyrians.
