Welcome to my inn.
Welcome to my inn, #!
Aren't you tired during your travels? We have prepared a room for you on the second floor.
Hungry? Thirsty? What do you want, #?
Welcome to the finest tavern in all of Essos!
Oh, another weary traveler. Come on, #, buy yourself a drink.
Welcome to my tavern! You will not find a better company than our drunks!
We've met before, #?
Come on, drink!
My customers say this is the best tavern in all of Essos. And you know what, #? They are absolutely right!
Don't stand there, #, buy yourself something to drink.
My visitors are the best people you have ever met. Isn't that right, friends? Well, back to the drink ... What do you want?
This place is not for nothing considered the best inn in the area, #.
Want to relax? On the second floor we have a couple of free rooms.
Is this your first time in these parts, #? You should meet my guests. They are funny guys!
Why are you standing in the corner, #? Talk to someone!
I have seen a lot in my life, heard a lot.
If I were you, I would certainly buy something to drink from the innkeeper.
The Sotorians are a nasty people. Try not to speak too loudly in front of them, #.
You are thirsty, I understand. Give me a couple of coins, I'll pour you.
I can drink any mercenary in this tavern!
If the tavern is a lot of fun, if its visitors are interesting and friendly, then the quality of the drinks can be ignored.
Come on, #. Have a drink! Otherwise, you're no better than a master!
The best drinks of Essos are only in my tavern!
It is you again, #?
Once a man came to me, he was sick ... he kept repeating that my tavern was not real, and our whole world was just a fiction of a mad scientist. Poor fellow ... drank too much ... too much.
Close the door behind you, #.
