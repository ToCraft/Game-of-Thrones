You must make a name for yourself in the Fox lands to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted and I will trade with you.
I'm not sure if you are a Fox supporter, #.
Are you a supporter of Fox, #?
I only trade with Fox supporters, #.
I'm not going to give out armor to every stranger ...
Who should own the Disputed Lands? What? I didn't hear the word "Fox".
I donâ€™t trust you enough to hand out the armor yet.
You must show your loyalty to Fox, #, before we bargain.
Only Fox supporters can order gear from me.
