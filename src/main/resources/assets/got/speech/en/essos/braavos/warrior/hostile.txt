You can't go any further. The lands of Braavos are not your lands!
Warriors of Braavos! Fight for your master!
I will not miss you on the lands of Braavos, #!
For Braavos!
In the name of the Many-Faced God, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
Get out of here, you filthy slave owner!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
Now you will grab it! The slave owners won't help you!
The enemies of Braavos are not allowed to roam these lands!
