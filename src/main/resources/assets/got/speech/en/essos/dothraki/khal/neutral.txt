My riders won't follow you, #.
Who are you? Are you not a dirty sheep breeder?
You won't get warriors.
Are you with us or against us?
Who do you serve, #?
Where is your horse, #?
Have you seen the wife of Khal Drogo? Khal Drogo was a great warrior, but died because of the witch. We must bring his widow to Vaes Dothrak.
I haven't heard of you.
