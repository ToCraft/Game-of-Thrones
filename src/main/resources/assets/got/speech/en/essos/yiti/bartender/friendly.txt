Welcome to my inn.
Welcome, #!
Are you tired on the road? There is a room on the second floor.
Hungry? Thirsty? What do you want, #?
Welcome to the finest tavern in the entire Empire!
You look tired. Come on, have a drink.
How could I serve you today, #?
You look like a Westerner, #.
Welcome to my tavern! Our visitors will keep you company, #; do not drink alone.
Welcome my friend!
Greetings my friend. How can I help you?
I think you have come from distant lands, #. Looks like you are hungry. I will feed.
Hi, #! Do you need a room?
Sour milk is especially good!
Pomegranate juice is especially good!
Welcome to my tavern! How can I serve you, my friend?
