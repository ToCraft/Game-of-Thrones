Do you want to command the Tyroshians, #?
For a small handful of silver, you will be allowed to command the Tyroshians.
Bring some silver coins, and only then will you receive our mercenaries.
Have you come for the mercenaries?
Tirosh's men now respect you enough to follow you into battle, #.
For several dozen silver coins you can command brave and loyal soldiers.
If you want to lead my troops into battle, you will have to pay for them!
Give me some silver coins and I will give you some soldiers!
