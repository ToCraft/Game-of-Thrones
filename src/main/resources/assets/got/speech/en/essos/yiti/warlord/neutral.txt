Such a great man really deserves to lead an army. No, I'm talking about myself, #!
What? #? This is the first time I've heard this name. Only renowned warriors will lead the Imperial army!
Do you really think you can keep track of the army? You must be drunk, #. The wine has befuddled your mind.
I went through many battles, and I know how it feels when your companion dies. The bad of you will be the commander, #. I do not want meaningless sacrifices and I will not give you the army.
I don't care how much money you have, #. In our country, even roads are made of gold and steel. My people will not serve you!
My people won't follow you, #. They trust you no more than they trust an Ibbenian dwarf.
Prove that you are our friend, #, before I let you command our army.
You are not one of us, #. Not yet.
You are not worthy to command the great Imperial army! Move away, #.
