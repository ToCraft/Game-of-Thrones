I cannot trade with you, #. Sorry.
The Emperor would be angry with me if I equipped an outsider with our armor.
I'm sorry #, but you'll have to find your armor elsewhere. I won't sell you anything.
Blacksmithing is a noble craft. And what is created thanks to this craft should only go to the worthy.
I will not believe that you can bring honor and glory to my smithy.
I'm sorry, but I won't give you my weapon even for money, #. How do I know that you will use them for good purposes?
I only sell my wares to noble people.
I've never heard of you, warrior from the West. How do I know that you will not turn my own weapon against my family?
Words are just empty sounds. You must prove in practice that you want to protect my people.
We are not stupid enough to believe outsiders, #.
Are you fighting for the Emperor, #, or for the black girl from the North?
I haven't heard of you, #. I sell my weapons only to true heroes, whose name our bards sing in their ballads.
Prove to me that you can be trusted before I provide you with my services.
When my people call your name with tears of happiness in their eyes, #, I will trade with you.
