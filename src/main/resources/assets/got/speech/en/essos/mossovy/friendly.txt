Good day, wanderer.
What brings you to these lands?
It's not safe here.
The night is dark and full of terrors.
Find yourself shelter before sunset.
They say werewolves came here after the Rock of a Thousand Islands.
Have you heard the legend of the Thousand Islands?
These vile creatures come out at night.
Only monster hunters can defeat werewolves.
You won't survive here, #.
Sorcerers from Asshai do not give rest to these lands.
Our people are almost extinct.
The Ithians are so afraid of werewolves that they built the Five Strongholds. A-ha-ha-ha!
