Hi, #!
Welcome, #.
Welcome my friend #. What can I do for you?
Welcome, #. What business are you with us?
Welcome, #. We are glad to new people.
Good day, #.
What are you doing in our area, traveler?
Have you already been to the "pillow house", #? Or are you not one of those?
We regard love as an art.
What's the news, #?
The disputed land belongs to us by right.
Tell me # what's going on in the world.
I am your faithful friend, #, as long as you are loyal to our people.
I hope you have good news, #?
ABOUT, #! We've met before, haven't we? Or I'm wrong?
Well, here we are, #!
Have you seen the Faceless Ones? You'd better not see them.
I hope you're not a former slave?
