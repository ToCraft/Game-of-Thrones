Hey ho! I'm going to the bottle!
I drink, so I'm busy.
Oooh, Moroooz, Moroooooz, do not change the frost! My horse!
My beer! My!!!
Stop running up the wall, #! Ho! Ho!
Beer here and there! Yes, it's everywhere!
I can't live without my beer!
My beer!
I'll drink until the end of the night, leave me alone!
More beer in my bucket!
Mushrooms! Mushrooms! Mushrooms!
I was once an adventurer, but then I drank beer.
* Ir *
Help! I'm all square! How long have I been here? I'm going crazy? Please help me!
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of your fine beer!
They see me! They see you! They see everything and everyone!
A full bucket of beer is more beautiful than the morning birdsong!
Sing! Sing!
Sing #! Sing with me!
How dare you oppress me?
Just give me a reason and I'll have a beer!
Okay, okay, don't delay! I haven't seen you for about a year, #!
Get away from me, drunkard!
You can't drink so much * hic *, #, you're a fool.
Oh Gods! What a beautiful day!
Ah, my old friend! Welcome home!
Either you get away from me now, or I'll drag you in!
Mine .. mine .. minyu .. to me ... it seems to me that you are a strange person.
Alcohol from you a mile rushing! Away!
Why are you twitching so?
Yeah, smart guy means, huh?
Stay there!
Get out of my tavern!
There's always room for another mug of ale!
Oh, this is a great place!
Oh, I quite agree with you, #.
Great day! Um, what day is it?
Don't like drinking, #?
My old friend! Come on, have a drink with me, #.
Now is not the time for that.
I'm strong. I can speak loudly.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Do you want me to repeat my story to you?
Louder, #! I can barely hear you.
You're a decrepit old man, aren't you?
I am very smart, #. Seriously, I'm really smart.
I'll tell you what I should have said a long time ago. You're a fool!
Here I am!
My God, who turned out the light?
I like to fool around.
Maybe it's time to go home, #?
