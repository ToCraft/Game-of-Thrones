Leave this jungle, #!
You don't belong in our homeland!
Die, corsair dog!
You won't be here long, #!
A weakling like you won't last long in the jungle!
I will feed you to crocodiles!
Run, servant of evil!
Pirate of the North! Get out, #!
Your death will be quick, #!
Run while you can, # however, it won't save you!
You're not welcome here, friend of the Harpy people!
You weren't killed by the beasts in the jungle? Then I'll do it!
Blue sorcerers won't be able to save you now, #!
You will choke on your own blood, #!
The Harpy has no power here, #!
