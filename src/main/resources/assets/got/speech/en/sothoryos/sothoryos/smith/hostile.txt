No more friendship with you, #!
Corsairs! Rootless bastards! Slaves of enemies! You are all dead in my eyes.
Corsair of the Desert! You will get nothing but death from me!
How stupid you came here, #!
The jungle beasts will tear you apart!
Now you have no hope, #!
Where did you get the idea that you deserve to own my blades, #?
The Harpy's roar is not heard here!
Our warriors will crush you, pirate!
I will not trade with a corsair from across the sea!
Come and see the sharp end of my daggers!
You can't even look at my forge!
Come closer, # ... if you dare!
You’re lucky that I don’t get into you myself!
