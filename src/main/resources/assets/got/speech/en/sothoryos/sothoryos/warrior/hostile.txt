You Giscari bastard! Die!
Run while you still can, slave of evil!
Your death will be slow and painful, #!
Prepare to die, friend of our enemies!
Your people are not welcome here!
I will avenge our stolen gods!
We will throw your bones to the crocodiles!
We will sprinkle your blood on the ground, #!
You will die in agony from the poison of the scorpion!
Get out to the spiders in the lands of the East!
You are stupid to rebel against the might of the old empire!
You are worse than a demon from the east. There is no place for you here!
Another pirate from the northern seas. To kill him!
You're worse than a rabid spider, #!
Is this a challenge to the might of our empire?
You are stupid, since you came here, and now, #, you will die!
