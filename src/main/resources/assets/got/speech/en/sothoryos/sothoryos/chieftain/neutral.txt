Come another day, #. You are not worthy yet.
You are not fit to lead my people, #.
Prove your loyalty in battle, and kill as many colonizing rats as possible, then you will earn our trust.
Prove to me that you are more than a simple traveler, #.
Are you capable of fighting? Go and kill some more pirates!
You will teach my warriors nothing but weakness.
Do you want to command my people? This is a joke? You don't deserve my respect, #.
Only great warriors are worthy to lead other warriors. You are not a great warrior.
How did you decide that you are worthy to lead my people, #?
Go and kill all the Harpy people in the North, and then maybe you can hire my warriors.
Pathetic. Not a single scar on your face. You are incapable of commanding my warriors.
I see no reason to give you my warriors.
Travel east and slay the many-legged demons. And then we'll talk.
