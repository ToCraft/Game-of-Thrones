I have no business with you, #!
Corsairs! Rootless bastards! Slaves of enemies! You are all dead in my eyes.
Corsair of the Desert! You will get nothing from me but death!
How stupid you did when you came here, #!
The beasts in the jungle will tear you to pieces!
You can not hope for salvation, #!
Where did you get the idea that you deserve to trade with me, #?
I'll cook you in a cauldron!
The Harpy's roar does not reach here!
Our warriors will crush you, pirate brat!
I will not trade with the corsairs of the North!
