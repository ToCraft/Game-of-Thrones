Welcome, #.
We are the doers of justice, we are the Lannister people.
These are tough times. The Starks are gathering troops in the north.
I am a knight of the West.
Welcome, #. What business is here?
Good day, #! Welcome!
Hello #. What news have you brought from other lands?
We are ready to face the enemies, #. Lannisters always pay their debts.
You are on time, #. A war with the Starks is about to begin.
It seems to me that soon only ruins and mountains of ash will remain of Westeros.
Have you seen Braavos, #? What a sight!
Stay away from the Wall, #. Strange people live behind her.
I heard stories about dragons when I was a child. But who knows if they really exist ...
