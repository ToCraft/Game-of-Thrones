You can't go any further. The lands of the West are not your lands!
Warriors of the West! Fight for your lord!
I won't let you into Lannister lands, #!
For the West!
You are Lord Tywin's enemy, #!
Enemies have entered the Lannister lands!
I swear by the Sereries, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a warrior of the West!
No pity for the enemies of the West!
You won't live to see sunset, servant of the Starks!
Get out of our lands, wolf!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the West are not allowed to roam these lands!
Hear my roar, wolf!
