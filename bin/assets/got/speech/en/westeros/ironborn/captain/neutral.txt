Give you a detachment? You are not worthy of one man!
Come back when you prove yourself to my people, #!
Do you think I'll let a vagrant command my warriors? Hah! No. Never.
Money alone will not be enough to earn the right to command the Ironborn.
First, you must prove that you are a good warrior, #, and that I can trust you with my people.
Come back when you glorify your name!
Do you think the Ironborn will follow you?
I don't give people away to all passing strangers.
Do you want to hire troops? Prove to our people that you are their protector and hero, and our people will follow you even to the ends of the earth!

I do not allow a vagabond to command my people.
