You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of Dorne!
You are the enemy of the Martells, #!
Get out of the lands of Dorn!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you #.
I forge nothing for the lions! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Ugly lions! How dare you come to the lands of Dorn?
Prince Martell's brave men will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
