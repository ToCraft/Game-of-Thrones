I fight for Dorn, #.
These deeds will restore Dorn to its former glory!
The enemies of House Martell will fall before us!
For Dorn!
Our enemies will fall to the might of Dorn, #!
You are a true friend, #.
Today we will fight! Let's fight for the house of the Martells!
We will follow you even to King's Landing!
We are proud to be able to fight for a great man like you!
Dorn's enemies will fall!
Unbowed, unbend, unbroken!
