Don't get into a fight, I'll finish you off with one bottle!
Yo-ho-ho! And a bottle of ale!
You are a beautiful girl, #.
Raaaaaaargh!
You ... what did you tell me? You insulted .. Hik!. Beat me like that?
Today, #, we will feast like kings!
Hands off my drink!
When I was little, I swam in the lake, and the fish bit me off ...
Here and there, here and there, we wander along the de-e-village!
Good day, #! Or is it morning? No, it's night, the sun is visible!
Hey ho! My bottle-jar ...
Ay-le! Ay-le! Sweet ail! Oh yeah! Yes!
Death of the mountaineer ... Ik! .. to the knights!
The bottle is life! The bottle is light! I have to crawl to the bottle!
I will decorate the whole Valley with my little mug!
Oh, frost, moro-oz! Don't moro-oh-oh-oh me! Zamoro-oz co-o-onya
