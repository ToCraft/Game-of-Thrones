Death will soon overtake you, #!
They don't want to see you here!
Damn you, #!
Wait, #. You don't come here!
Run, friend of the Andals!
Raaaargh!
Death to the knights!
You will fall, #!
What kind of death do you want to die?
When you face the gods, tell them that I sent you!
Come on, scum, run back to your mom!
Death to you and your people!
Get away, you bastard!
You will pay for your crimes, #!
