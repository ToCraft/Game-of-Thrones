I have a lot of strong warriors ready for battle, #!
My warriors will serve you if you pay.
Looking for mercenaries, #?
Few can resist the might of the Highlanders!
We, the Highlanders of the Mountains of the Moon, are proud and loyal warriors.
My people will follow you into battle without fear, they will not retreat.
Have extra money, #?
Death to the knights!
Have you come here to slay the Knights of the Vale? Then my people will fight side by side with you!
Everyone flees from the might of the mountaineers!
Give me some money, and all the power of our people will be revealed to you!
