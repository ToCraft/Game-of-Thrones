We don't trust you, #!
My people fight side by side only with the faithful warriors of the Free People.
What makes you think that I will let you command my people, #?
You have killed too few Southerners, #!
Your hands are not stained with southern blood, #, you don't fit into our team.
Prove your power in battle, and only then will my people follow you.
Spill more blood, #, and only then you will become worthy of my people.
My people will lift axes for true warriors. You are not a warrior.
The horror of the coming battles will frighten away all weaklings like you.
My powerful people will not follow a weak leader.
You haven't spilled enough blood, #!
You are weak, as are the dirty southerners! Go and bring death! Only then will my people fight for you, #.
