Didn't the brave men of the Free People drive you out, scum?
I will gut you like a pig!
Enjoy your last breath, scum!
Kill the bastard!
I found meat! To kill him!
Fears from you!
Die, scum!
Your blood smells so good ...
I'll roast you like a piece of meat!
You better run, slug!
Just come and I'll rip you apart like a rabbit!
You mess with the wrong people, bastard!
I'll have your head, southerner bastard!
