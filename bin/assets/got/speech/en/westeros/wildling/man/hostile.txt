I'll smash your face!
Die, spy of the southerners!
Who are you? Get out of here!
I will crush your skull!
Run, run while you can!
You are the enemy of the Free People. These are the first to die!
You will die faster than you blink an eye, #!
I will break your legs, and you will not run anywhere else!
Your pathetic ancestors will not hear you call for help!
Death to you and your families!
I will tear you like a rabbit!
Die, #!
Die!
I'd rather hear your screams of pain!
Soon you will screech, pig rat!
Damn you, Stark spy!
I'll peel your skin off!
Heheh, your head is next to be impaled on a lance, #!
