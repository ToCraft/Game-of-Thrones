You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of the king!
You are the enemy of King Joffrey, #!
Get out of the Royal Lands!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you #.
I forge nothing for the wolves! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Ugly wolves! How dare you come to the Royal Lands?
King Joffrey's brave men will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
