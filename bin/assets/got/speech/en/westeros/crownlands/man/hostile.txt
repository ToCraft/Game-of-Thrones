You are not my friend, #.
You are a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
Run, #, or I'll call the guards!
I will not allow you to commit atrocities on my land!
You're a notorious villain, #.
Who let you in here ?!
Be careful. It's not safe for freaks like you.
We do not respect criminals.
Please go away, #.
Away!
Our people hate villains! Get out while you're alive!
You'd better leave, #. Otherwise, you will be carried out of here with your feet.
You should be in stocks, #!
Do not look at me so.
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
We treat people like you badly.
Get out, #!
You should have left this land a long time ago!
You will pay for your crimes, #!
We will not tolerate your presence in these parts, #!
You are a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
In an amicable way, please leave, #.
Get out of here!
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
You are not welcome here, #. Better get out of here, pick up, hello
You are rude! Back where you came from!
Security! Security!
Murderers are not welcome on our edge.
You will pay for your crimes!
Stay away from me.
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
Get out, villain!
There is no place for people like you!
