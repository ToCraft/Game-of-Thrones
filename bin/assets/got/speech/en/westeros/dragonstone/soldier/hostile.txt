You can't go any further. The lands of the true king are not your lands!
Warriors of Dragonstone! Fight for your king!
I will not let you into the lands of the true king, #!
For Stannis!
You are the enemy of King Stannis, #!
Enemies have entered the lands of the true king!
In the name of the Lord of Light, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for the warrior Stannis!
No pity for Stannis' enemies!
You won't live to see sunset, Lannister servant!
Get out of our lands, lion spawn!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
Stannis' enemies are not allowed to roam these lands!
