You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of Dragonstone!
You are the enemy of King Stannis, #!
Get out of Dragonstone!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you #.
I forge nothing for the lions! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Ugly lions! How dare you come to Dragonstone?
The brave men of the true king will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
