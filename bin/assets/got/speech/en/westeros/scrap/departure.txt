Well, #. Are you going to keep this stuff with you forever?
# Are you sure you have no metal in stock? I'm in a hurry, time is short.
It's time for me to leave, #. So hurry up if you want me to take your stuff with me.
I'm sure we can get another deal done in time, #.
Maybe sell me some metal before I leave this land?
It is not difficult to sell scrap metal, but it takes a lot of time to search, #. So before I leave, can you take a little more time and find some metal for the poor trash buyer?
I deserve a rest. So hurry up, #! Get me some junk to sell and I can leave.
It seems to me that it makes no sense to stay here for a long time. Few products. I will soon go to richer lands.
Scrap metal is much more expensive, cham pebbles and sticks, #. But I will buy both. Bring it here soon!
The road calls me forward, #! Who am I to challenge this call? Just a trash buyer ... So before I leave, let me save you some extra trash.
I feel thirsty, #. Staying in a good pub will do me good! Fortunately, I know one of these near the Blue Mountains. I'm impatient, but I can wait a little longer. Get your goods, #.
I won't stay here forever, #.
The tavern bed beckons me, #. Trash buyers should sleep too!
Hurry up, hurry up! This is my last deal, and then I will go to other lands.
You don't have a room for me, #? No? Then I will be forced to leave.
Trash dealers constantly travel to find new and new goods from the battlefield and from the frugal warriors. And I'm no exception, #.
In these places, I am not particularly lucky with trade. Looks like I should visit other places.
I have learned that Essos is full of debris from various armor and blades. Perhaps I would rather go to them than wait for you forever, #.
