Do you want to command our troops, friend?
These people will follow your instructions for a small fee, #.
Bring some silver coins, and you can take several brothers under your banner.
Do you need help from brothers?
I can provide you with the best warriors in return for silver coins.
The members of the fraternity now respect you enough to follow your instructions, #.
The members of the brotherhood can easily hide from enemy eyes. It will not be difficult for you to shoot enemies together with them.
My warriors are the best marksmen in the Riverlands. They can attack the enemy without being noticed.
