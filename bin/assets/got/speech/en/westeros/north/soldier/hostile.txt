You can't go any further. The lands of the North are not your lands!
Warriors of the North! Fight for your lord!
I won't let you into Stark lands, #!
For the North!
You are the enemy of Lord Stark, #!
Enemies have entered the Stark lands!
I swear by the Old Gods, I will kill you!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
To fall in battle is an honor for a warrior of the North!
No pity for the enemies of the North!
You won't live to see sunset, Lannister servant!
Get out of our lands, Lannister rot!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
In the name of the kings of antiquity, I will destroy you!
The enemies of the North are not allowed to roam these lands!
The North remembers, the Lannister brat!
