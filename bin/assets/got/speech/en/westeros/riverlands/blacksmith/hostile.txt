You won't get anything!
You are the enemy of the Riverlands!
You are the enemy of Lord Tully, #!
Get out of the Riverlands!
Get out of my sight, you are disgusting!
I refuse to trade with villains like you, #.
I'm not forging anything for the Lannister brat! Away!
You won't get anything from me, #!
Filthy lions! How dare you come to the Riverlands?
Lord Tully's brave men will kill you quickly!
I will not give you anything, #!
