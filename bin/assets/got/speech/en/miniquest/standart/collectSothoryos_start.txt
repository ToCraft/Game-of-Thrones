Hi, #. We are glad to see guests in the jungle. However, instead of guests, the corsairs of Giscard often dock at us, robbing and killing our people. Recently, a neighboring settlement was robbed. We help them to recover, we give everything that we have. But we don't have $. Help us get it and we will thank you!
