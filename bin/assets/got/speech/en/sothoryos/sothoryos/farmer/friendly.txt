Our fields are rich and abundant, #. We will never let our people go hungry.
The Harpy people are plundering our fields and burning our land. But our people won't starve for these corsairs!
We grow the largest harvests in the world, unlike the Guiscard pirates, they only know how to steal!
The jungle is kind to us, #.
These forests give us life, and in turn, we help them grow.
We have grown many crops, #. The jungle bless us.
Admire these trees and fields, #, without their fruits, we would not have survived.
We are kind to the earth, so we can sleep peacefully on it.
War? It wasn't war that made us rich, #. These were fields and trees.
Too many have forgotten that we owe our entire lives to the jungle. Shamans know this, but they are few.
If you are wise, # you will eat mangoes. It's delicious.
Do you want to buy something from the jungle?
The jungle gives us fruit, # but I ask for some silver in return.
The best food in the world!
I offer a wide variety of crops for sale.
Are you hungry, #?
Our people work in the fields carefully and accurately.
Are you looking for helpers for your farm? I have several workers looking for a landowner.
