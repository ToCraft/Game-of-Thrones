You don't have my trust yet, #. Come back another day!
I don't want your mango, #.
Prove your friendship with our people, and then you can buy my weapon.
You look like a problem, #.
I doubt you have enough money for my items.
You are not like one of us.
I bet you love banana bread, #. Fool!
You are not a friend of my people, #. Away.
I doubt you're better than the Harpy people, #.
Take care of yourself, #. It is unwise to find enemies in this jungle.
