You can't go any further. The Giscard lands are not your lands!
Warriors of Giscard! Fight for our people!
I will not miss you on the lands of Guiscard, #!
For Guiscard!
Your death will be swift!
You won't live long, #!
Get out of here, slave brat!
I will not let you harm my people, #!
The enemies of Giscard are not allowed to roam these lands!
