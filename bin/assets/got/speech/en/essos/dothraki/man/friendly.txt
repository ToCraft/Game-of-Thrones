Hello warrior.
Are you with us, #?
What do you want?
Blood will be spilled soon!
What do you need here?
Hey #. What brings you here?
Have you been traveling for a long time, #?
Why did you come? Union, trade or war?
I haven't seen someone like you for a long time.
Have you come to seek friendship or death here?
How did you get here, #, and why?
