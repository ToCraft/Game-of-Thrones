You must prove that you can be trusted.
Who are you for, #? For us, Fox or World?
I believe that you should not be trusted. Try to convince me.
Prove your loyalty to the archon and I will give you a soldier.
I respect you as a person, but I do not trust you strongly.
It's foolish to count on the fact that I'll just take it and believe you, #.
You need to become a strong ally of Tyrosh, #.
You need to do more good deeds for the Tyroshian people.
Prove your loyalty to Tyrosh and I will follow you.
