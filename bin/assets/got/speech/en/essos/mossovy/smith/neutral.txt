You have to make a name for yourself in the Valley to trade with me.
Prove that you can be trusted, and I will trade with you.
I am not sure that you are a supporter of Lord Arryn, #.
Are you an Arryn supporter, #?
I only trade with Arryn supporters, #. I don't supply equipment to Lannisters.
I'm not going to give out armor to every stranger...
you have to prove your loyalty to the Lord of the Eagle's Nest if you want to trade with me.
I don't trust you enough yet to give away the armor.
You must show your loyalty to the Arryns, #, before we bargain.
Only Arryn supporters can order equipment from me.
