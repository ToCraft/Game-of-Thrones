Welcome to Mossovy, #.
We are the guardians of the fallen kingdom, we are the guardians of the Far East..
These are hard times.
Welcome, #. On what business in Mossovy?
Greetings, #. What news have you brought from other lands?
We are ready to move against Assay, #.
You are on time, #. The Ithians are increasing their military presence on the borders.
It seems to me that soon only ruins and mountains of ashes will remain from the east.
We live in fear, #. If you don't like to take risks, I advise you to go to Quart. And it's not safe here.
Have you seen a mammoth, #? What a sight!
Stay away from thieves, #. Strange people with strange tasks.
I heard stories about dragons when I was a kid. But who knows if they really exist...
