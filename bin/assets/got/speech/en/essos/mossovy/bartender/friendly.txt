Welcome to my inn.
Welcome to my inn, #!
Are you not tired during your travels? We have prepared a room for you on the second floor.
Hungry? Thirsty? What do you want, #?
Welcome to the best tavern in all of Essos!
Oh, another tired traveler. Come on, #, buy yourself something to drink.
Welcome to my inn! You won't find a better company than our drunks!
We've met before, #?
Come on, drink!
My customers say it's the best tavern in all of Essos. And you know what, #? They are absolutely right!
Don't stand there, #, buy yourself something to drink.
My visitors are the best people you've ever met. Isn't that right, friends? Well, back to the booze... What do you want?
This place is not for nothing considered the best tavern in the area, #.
Do you want to relax? We have a couple of spare rooms on the second floor.
This is your first time in these parts, #? You should meet my guests. They're funny guys!
Why are you standing in the corner, #? Talk to someone!
I've seen a lot of things in my life, heard a lot of things.
If I were you, I would definitely buy something to drink from the innkeeper.
Thieves are nasty types. Try not to speak too loudly in front of them, #.
You're thirsty, I understand. Give me a couple of coins, I'll pour you some.
I can out-drink any knight in this tavern!
If the tavern is very fun, if its visitors are interesting and friendly, then you can ignore the quality of drinks.
Come on, #. Have a drink! Otherwise, you're no better than, ugh, a southern alchemist!
The best drinks of Essos are only in my tavern!
You again, #?
Once a guy came to me, he was bad... he kept saying that my tavern wasn't real, and that our whole world was just the fiction of a mad scientist. Poor guy... I've had too much to drink... too much.
Close the door behind you, #.
