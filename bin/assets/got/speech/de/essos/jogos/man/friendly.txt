Hey, #. What brings you here?
These are the ancestral lands of the Jogos-Nhai people.
Have you been traveling for a long time, #?
Why did you come? Union, trade or war?
I haven't seen anyone like you for a long time.
Have you come here to seek friendship or death?
I hope you're not a dwarf from the North, #.
How did you get here, #, and why?
You don't serve the Great Enemy in the south, #?
See the greatness of Tugar Khan!
If you were a Southerner, you'd be nothing but sun-charred bones.
Have you heard the legend of Zhiye? She personally killed the Great Enemy and made a bowl out of his skull.
It's strange, you crossed the mountains alone and survived.
Once upon a time, a Great Enemy ruled the lands from sea to sea.
I don't like smelly dwarfs from the North.
